# TUPLE

# List is represented by [ ]
# Tuple is represented by ( )

# Item assignement is important.
# Two operations:
#    1. find count
#    2. find index




# to find count:

#marks = (95, 95, 95, 98, 97)
#print(marks.count(95))




# to find index:

marks = (95, 95, 95, 98, 97)
print(marks.index(95))





# NOTE: It is not necessary to use () parenthesis in Tuple.

# i.e. person = "ram", "shyam". "abhi"
# print(person)
# Here, printed output will be a tuple.
