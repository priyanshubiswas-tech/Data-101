# SET

# Pre requisite - IMPs:

#    [ ] = List
#    ( ) = Tuple
#    { } = Set    ; unordered.



# Set is represented by { }

#marks = {95, 95, 95, 98, 97}

# In the above code, 95 will be printed once not thrice because SET stores -
# only unique values.


# NOTE: We cannot use index to iterate.


# We can use a loop.

for score in marks:

# NOTE: SETs are called unordered, because there is no index.
