## üìò Short Notes: WHERE vs HAVING Clause in SQL

### üîπ WHERE Clause
- Filters **rows** **before** any grouping or aggregation.
- Can be used with any SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE query.
- Cannot be used with aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM table
WHERE condition;
```

### üîπ HAVING Clause
- Filters **groups** **after** `GROUP BY` is applied.
- Can be used **only with GROUP BY** or aggregates.
- Can filter on aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, etc.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column, AGG_FUNC(column)
FROM table
GROUP BY column
HAVING AGG_FUNC(column) condition;
```
