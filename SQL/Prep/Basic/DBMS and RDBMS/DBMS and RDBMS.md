âœ… Concept: DBMS vs RDBMS
DBMS (Database Management System):
A software for storing and managing data.

Data can be stored in any format (hierarchical, network, etc.).

No strict relationship between data.

Examples: Microsoft Access, file systems.

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):
A type of DBMS based on the relational model (tables with rows and columns).

Tables can be linked using foreign keys.

Enforces data integrity using constraints.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
